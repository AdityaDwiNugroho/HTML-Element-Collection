# HTML Element Collection

A collection of reusable **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** components in a single file. This project is meant to help beginners and contributors build, share, and explore simple UI elements and snippets.

## Purpose

This repository is designed for learners and open-source enthusiasts to contribute their custom **HTML/CSS/JS elements** (like buttons, cards, forms, modals, etc.) in one place.  
It’s beginner-friendly and encourages experimentation.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from everyone! Follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/HTML-Element-Collection.git
   cd HTML-Element-Collection

3. **Add your component** inside the main file (`index.html`).

   * Each element should include **HTML structure**, styling with **CSS**, and functionality with **JavaScript** if needed.
   * Comment your code with your name or GitHub handle so others can recognize contributors.
4. **Commit your changes**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added [your component name]"
   ```
5. **Push to your fork**:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
6. **Create a Pull Request (PR)** from your forked repository back to this repo.

## Example

Here’s a sample card component:

```html
<!-- Example: Simple Card Component by @username -->
<div class="card">
  <h3>Card Title</h3>
  <p>This is a sample card component contributed to the collection.</p>
  <button>Read More</button>
</div>

<style>
  .card {
    border: 1px solid #ddd;
    padding: 15px;
    border-radius: 8px;
    max-width: 250px;
  }
  .card button {
    background-color: #007acc;
    color: white;
    border: none;
    padding: 8px 12px;
    border-radius: 4px;
    cursor: pointer;
  }
  .card button:hover {
    background-color: #005f99;
  }
</style>
```

## Contribution Guidelines

Would you also like me to prepare a **starter `index.html` template** (with a placeholder section for contributors) so people can just paste their components neatly?
